Predicting Protein Secondary Structure using a Fully Convolutional Network

## Introduction
This project aims to predict protein secondary structure using a fully convolutional network (FCN). Protein secondary structure prediction is an important task in bioinformatics and can provide valuable insights into protein function and folding.

## Dataset
The project will utilize the XYZ dataset, which consists of a large collection of protein sequences with annotated secondary structure labels. The dataset will be preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
The FCN architecture will be designed to capture local and global dependencies in protein sequences. It will consist of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and fully connected layers. The model will be trained using a suitable loss function and optimized using gradient descent.

## Training and Evaluation
The model will be trained on the training set using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. The training progress will be monitored using metrics such as accuracy and loss. The model's performance will be evaluated on the validation set, and hyperparameter tuning may be performed to improve performance.

## Results and Discussion
The project will present the results of the trained model on the testing set, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the FCN will be compared to existing methods in protein secondary structure prediction. The limitations and potential future improvements of the model will also be discussed.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aims to develop a fully convolutional network for predicting protein secondary structure. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we hope to improve the accuracy and efficiency of protein secondary structure prediction, contributing to advancements in bioinformatics research.
